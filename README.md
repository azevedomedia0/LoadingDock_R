## Features

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **App launcher grid** | Search, drag-and-drop reorder, 72 px icon tiles with CDN images |
| **Recommended catalog** | 26+ curated self-hosted apps; one-click GET install with pre-filled env vars and volumes |
| **Docker lifecycle** | Launch / stop / restart containers; live log streaming; health badges; CPU/MEM metrics |
| **Compose import** | YAML → one app per service |
| **Embedded Web UI** | In-app iframe that auto-loads `openUrl` when container starts; or open in system browser |
| **Desktop shortcuts** | `.app` bundle created on `~/Desktop` on install; icon fetched from Dashboard Icons CDN |
| **System tray** | Per-app live status dots, click-to-launch, Stop All / Restart All |
| **Secrets** | OS keychain for sensitive env vars; masking in the detail view |

| **Open at Login** | macOS login item toggle in the settings footer |

---

## Registry & Settings

App definitions are stored in `apps.json` in the OS-native config directory:

| Platform | Path |
|----------|------|
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/loading-dock/apps.json` |
| Linux | `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/loading-dock/apps.json` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%/loading-dock/apps.json` |

Same folder also contains: `settings.json`, `metrics.json`, `errors.jsonl`.

App data volumes are stored under `~/.loading-dock/<app-name>/`.

---

## Release Channels

Use the **Channel** dropdown in the launcher footer (`stable` default, `beta` opt-in).

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Docker warning banner** — start Docker Desktop and reopen The Loading Dock(r).
- **Launch fails** — check the image name and host port conflicts (`host:container`, e.g. `8080:80`).
- **Web UI won't load** — ensure the container is **running** and `openUrl` matches your mapped port.
- **No health/metrics** — container must be running; Docker CLI must be reachable from Bun.
- **Reset apps** — delete `apps.json` from the path above and relaunch.
- **Desktop icon doesn't launch** — ensure The Loading Dock(r) is running; the shortcut connects via `localhost:42424`.
